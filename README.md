*Description* : A multithreaded chat application is a client-server-based program that allows multiple users to communicate in real time. Using Java sockets and multithreading, the application establishes seamless, concurrent interactions between clients and a central server. This type of application is ideal for instant messaging, collaborative work environments, and real-time discussions.

In this project, we’ll build a chat system consisting of two main components: a server and multiple clients. The server will manage client connections and facilitate message exchange, while the clients will send and receive messages through the server. Java sockets will handle network communication, and multithreading will enable simultaneous interactions without blocking other processes.

The server’s role is critical in managing multiple clients. It listens for incoming connections on a specific port and spawns a new thread for each connected client. This thread is responsible for handling the communication with that particular client, ensuring that each conversation remains independent. The server also broadcasts messages from one client to all others in the chat room.

On the client side, each user connects to the server via a socket and sends messages through an output stream while listening for incoming messages on an input stream. Multithreading ensures that sending and receiving messages happen concurrently without delay.

Key steps for building the multithreaded chat application:

1. Server Setup:
   - Create a server socket that listens for client connections.
   - Accept incoming connections and create a new thread for each client.
   - Maintain a list of connected clients.
   - Broadcast messages received from one client to all other clients.

2. Client Setup:
   - Connect to the server using a socket.
   - Create separate threads for sending and receiving messages.
   - Read user input and send it to the server.
   - Display messages received from the server.

3. Communication Protocol:
   - Use text-based messages.
   - Identify users by their assigned usernames.
   - Format messages to show the sender’s name and message content.

4. Error Handling:
   - Handle network failures, such as disconnections.
   - Manage server shutdowns gracefully.
   - Validate client input and manage exceptions.

5. Enhancements (Optional):
   - Add private messaging between users.
   - Implement user authentication.
   - Create a graphical user interface (GUI).

This project demonstrates important concepts like network programming, concurrency, and client-server architecture. A well-implemented multithreaded chat application ensures efficient message exchange, scalability for multiple users, and a responsive user experience. By using Java’s robust socket and threading libraries, this application delivers real-time, synchronized communication.
